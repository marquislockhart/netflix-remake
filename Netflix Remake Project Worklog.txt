After finishing the project for my Database Systems course, the Spotify interface that I modified, originally created by Adam Lowenthal (link Adam here), inspired me to base my next project around improving my own HTML,CSS, & JavaScript skills. I decided to do another remake of a famous service so I can focus on implementation instead of getting hung up on creativity.
